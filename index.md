# Welcome to my porfolio
I'm Fernando Freixinet from Barcelona, I'm 21 years old and here you will find some information about me and my projects.

Videogames have always been a part of my life and I'm really interested in the design aspect of videogames.
I know how to develop games using C++/C# and use game engines like Unity which I think could be very useful as a designer.
I love learning new things, I'm an organized person and I can easily adapt to the different necessities of the teams or the projects I'm working on.

# Education
I'm a videogame development student from the UPC (Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya),
currently studying on my last year of the degree. 
The degree I'm studying is teached entirely in einglish and its official name is "Graun en Disseny i Desenvolupament de Videojocs".

# Experience
I have more than one year of experience as a Unity Engine teacher at LifeCole, where I have to desing the diferent exercises
for the students and develop several educational projects. I teach the use of game engines and coding from the basics to the creation of finnished videogames.
